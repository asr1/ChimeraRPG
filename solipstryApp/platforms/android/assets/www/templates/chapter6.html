<p>
<strong>AC:</strong>See armor class

<strong>Alteration:</strong>Alteration is the school of magic dealing with changing
or manipulating the world. Items, biological organisms, and the minds of
others can easily be altered by spells in this school.

<strong>Armor Class:</strong>Armor class (commonly abbreviated AC) is a rating of how
difficult it is for a (typically melee) attack to hit a creature.

<strong>Aura:</strong>Some creatures may have an aura, or area around them, that is
affected by a certain effect, such as difficult terrain. Aura 1 means
that each square adjacent to a creature is affected; Aura 2 means that
each square within 2 is affected, etc.

<strong>Backfire:</strong>Some creatures may impose a percent chance to backfire. If
a spellcaster has a chance to backfire, she rolls a d100 when she casts
a spell. If she rolls under the chance she has to backfire, the spell
operates normally. If she rolls her chance or higher, the spell either
has the opposite effect as intended (glows instead of invisible, heal
instead of hurt, etc.) or has no effect at all, per the discretion of
the game master. If something gives a spellcaster a 20% chance to
backfire, this adds to any percent she may already have.
</p>
<p><strong>Blast:</strong> Blast <em>n</em> indicates a spell that affects an area <em>n</em> x <em>n</em> in
size that originates adjacent to that caster. For example, a blast 3
spell would target 9 squares, 3x3 in size, with at least one square
adjacent to the caster.</p>

<p><strong>Blinded:</strong>A blinded creature cannot see, and takes a -5 penalty to
attack rolls and the following skills: Acrobatics, Block, Engineering,
Melee Weapon</p>
<p>, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Ride/Drive, Security and Unarmed Combat.


<strong>Bloodied:</strong>A creature is bloodied when it has half of its hit points
(or less) remaining.</p>
<p>
<strong>Bull Rush:</strong>A character can charge, and, instead of making a regular
attack roll, can make an Unarmed Attack roll vs. the target’s Fortitude.
A successful hit deals no damage, but instead pushes the target back one
square, and the charging creature ends in the square the target just
exited. This does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature
targeted.
</p>
<p><strong>Burst:</strong> Burst <em>n</em> indicates that a spell affects an area that is <em>n</em>
x <em>n</em> in size. The center of the burst must be in range. For example,
burst 3 within a Destruction Range of 5 means that the spell will affect
9 squares, a 3x3 block, the center of which is no more than 5 squares
from the caster.</p>
<p>
<strong>Charge:</strong>As a standard action, a character can move its movement and
make an attack roll against a creature it ends adjacent to. This
provokes opportunity attacks normally. The following constraints must be
met before a charge:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Must be at least two squares between attacker and target.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Must travel in straight line.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Must go to closest, unoccupied square before attacking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Combat advantage:</strong>If a creature cannot operate as well as it should
in combat, it grants combat advantage. When attacking a creature
granting combat advantage, an attacker gains a +2 bonus to their attack
roll. Combat advantage is granted when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creatures are flanking</p>
</li>
<li><p>A creature is prone (Ranged attacks suffer a -1 penalty, and do NOT
have combat advantage.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>A creature is unaware of the attacker’s presence</p>
</li>
<li><p>A creature is taken by surprise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Confused:</strong>A confused creature cannot tell the difference between
allies and foes. It cannot flank, grants combat advantage, and will
attack creatures randomly.</p>

<p><strong>Conjuration:</strong>Conjuration is the school of magic that deals with
summoning or creating objects and creatures. Loyal creatures can be
beckoned or protective shields created by spells in this school. The
very weapons and armor one fights with can be brought forth in only a
second’s time. Creatures that are conjured are under the conjurer’s
control and disappear when the conjurer stops sustaining or falls
unconscious.</p>
<p>
<strong>Critical Hit:</strong>A critical hit, commonly referred to as a crit, is
achieved when a natural 20 is rolled on a d20. This inflicts maximum
damage, and allows the character to roll an additional damage die. If a
critical hit is achieved on a spell, the caster may recast the spell at
no cost, targeting any valid targets. A critical hit always hits, even
if a 20 would not result in a hit. 

<strong>Damage Multiplier:</strong>The number you multiply your damage roll by to get
your total damage.

<strong>Dazed:</strong>A dazed character can take one action on its turn, either a
standard, a move, or a minor action. A dazed character cannot make
opportunity attacks. If a power is sustain minor, the action can be used
to sustain. If a power is sustain (number), the sustain can be completed
without expending its one action one action allowed for that turn. Free
actions can be taken normally. A dazed creature grants combat advantage
and cannot flank.

<strong>Deafened:</strong>A deafened creature cannot hear, and takes a -2 penalty to
Interaction, Perception, and Sense Motive Checks.

<strong>Delay:</strong>A character who does not wish to take actions during their
turn can choose to delay until after another character’s turn. Delaying
moves the character to a new position in the initiative order. To delay
until after a specific action, see Ready an Action. Delaying cannot
delay harmful effects, such as ongoing damage, nor can they prolong
beneficial effects, such as a sustain (minor). Ongoing damage and
sustains must be dealt with before a character delays.

<strong>Destruction:</strong>The school of magic devoted to damaging people and the
environment. The very elements themselves can be controlled by the
spells in this school.

<strong>Difficult Terrain:</strong>Certain terrain, such as tall grass, water, deep
snow, or piles of corpses, can be difficult to navigate. Whenever
travelling such terrain, all movement costs two squares of movement for
each square moved. Creatures cannot shift in difficult terrain.</p>

<p><strong>Dispelled</strong>: A creature that is dispelled cannot regenerate magic.</p>

<p><strong>Disrupted:</strong>A disrupted creature cannot attack or cast offensive
spells.

<strong>Dominated:</strong>A dominated creature acts like a dazed one in that they
can make one action on their turn, and cannot make opportunity attacks.
A dominated creature is controlled by another creature, the dominator.
The dominated creature can take no actions by itself, but rather the
dominator chooses one action for it to take. This one action can be a
move, minor, or standard. No powers or effects (except grabbing) can be
sustained while a creature is dominated. A dominated creature grants
combat advantage and cannot flank.

<strong>Dying:</strong>A dying creature is unconscious and helpless and has zero hit
points. Successful attacks on the dying immediately kill the target. A
dying creature must be stabilized before they can be healed.

<strong>Escape:</strong>Escaping from rope or shackles is done by making an escape
check vs. the difficulty level of the restraints. Alternatively,
restraints can be attacked and destroyed. Escaping from a grab is done
by making an Escape check vs. the initial attack roll that caused the
grab.

<strong>Falling Damage:</strong>A character takes falling damage equal to 1d10 per 10
feet fallen. For more specific rules, see Improvised Damage, page 96.</p>
<p>
<strong>Flanking:</strong>When two allies are flanking a creature, that creature
grants combat advantage to those two allies. Flanking occurs when two
allies are standing on opposite sides of an enemy. If the enemy occupies
more than one square, the allies do not need to be immediately across
from one another, so long as they are on opposite sides, and immediately
adjacent to the creature.

<strong>Flight:</strong>A creature with flight can leave the ground and fly the
specified number of squares. Unless they have hover, they must land at
the end of their turn or they will fall. Leaving the ground provokes
opportunity attacks, but travelling through the air does not, unless the
other creature is also in the air..

<strong>Forced Movement:</strong>See Pull, Push, or Slide</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ledges:</strong> A creature that is being pushed, Bull Rushed, or slid
off a ledge can make a saving throw. On a success, the character
falls prone instead of moving off the ledge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Teleporting:</strong>A creature can be teleported directly into the air.
Any creature teleported into the air (or off of a ledge) makes a
saving throw. If they succeed, they fall prone in their square (or
adjacent to the edge) rather than teleporting upwards. On a failure,
the character is teleported, and takes falling damage as normal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Fortitude:</strong>A creature’s defense used to resist forced movement,
poisons, and similar effects.</p>
<p>
<strong>Grab/Grapple:</strong>Grabbing a creature is done by making an Unarmed Combat
attack roll vs. the target’s Reflex. When grabbed, a creature is
restrained until escape. Sustaining a grab is a minor action. A grabbed
creature can be subjected to forced movement, and if this movement
slides the grabbed creature out of reach of the grabber, the grab ends.

<strong>Grabbed:</strong> When grabbed, a creature is restrained until escape. A
grabbed creature can be subjected to forced movement, and if this
movement slides the grabbed creature out of reach of the grabber, the
grab ends.

<strong>Helpless:</strong>Any attack rolls against a helpless creature automatically
deal maximum damage, but do not count as critical hits, or gain the
additional damage die awarded for a critical hit. A creature counts as
helpless if it is unconscious or bound by ropes or chain.

<strong>Hover:</strong>A creature with hover can remain flying at the end of its
turn, with no need to land.

<strong>Immobilized:</strong>An immobilized creature cannot move, fly, or shift, but
can still teleport, and be pushed, pulled, or slid.
</p>
<p><strong>Intangible:</strong> A creature that is intangible takes half damage from
non-magical attacks, and double damage from damaging spells. Healing
spells restore twice as much hit points, and spells with non-sustaining
durations last twice as long.</p>
<p>
<strong>Insanity:</strong>Insanity can be caused by some monster’s attacks, certain
diseases, or even from just witnessing the horrors of battle. The
effects of insanity vary by victim (and GM), but common ailments include
delusions, making random attack rolls, attacking random targets,
choosing to/not to attack at inopportune times, uncontrollable laughter,
loud arguments with no one, uncontrollable spellcasting, INT and WIS
scores dropping to 5, extreme paranoia, and much, much more.

<strong>Invisible:</strong>An invisible creature cannot be seen, and thus gets a +5
bonus to stealth check rolls to hide from the sighted. Creatures unaware
of an invisible creature’s presence or exact location grant combat
advantage to the invisible creature. Invisible features have total
concealment against creatures that cannot see them.

<strong>Mark:</strong>A marked creature is thoroughly intimidated by the creature
that marked it. Marked creatures take a -2 penalty to attack rolls
against creatures other than the creature that marked it. In addition,
if a marked creature makes an attack that does not include the marker,
the marker may make an opportunity attack against the marked creature. A
mark ends when the marker falls unconscious or dies.

<strong>Minion</strong>:<em>**</em>Any enemy with only one hit point is considered a minion.
Minions never take damage on a missed attack.</p>

<p><strong>Modifier</strong>:<em>**</em>A modifier for a skill or attribute is determined by
taking the score divided by 10 (and rounding down).
</p>
<p><strong>Movement:</strong>The number of squares a creature can move. To calculate
movement, see creating a character.
</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing damage:</strong>Ongoing damage is damage that is taken at the start
of a creature’s turn until a successful saving throw is made.

<strong>Opportunity Attacks:</strong>Few creatures fight fairly. If an opportunity or
weakness presents itself in combat, opponents may make an attack against
the disadvantaged foe. Opportunity attacks can be made with either melee
weapon or unarmed attack, they cannot be made with ranged or spells. If
unarmed attack is used, only one attack can be made. Each creature can
only make one opportunity attack per round. Opportunity attacks can be
made when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A creature leaves a square adjacent to an enemy without shifting</p>
</li>
<li><p>A creature casts a ranged spell or makes a Ranged attack roll while
adjacent to an enemy</p>
</li>
<li><p>A creature takes off into the air while adjacent to an enemy</p>
</li>
<li><p>A marked creature makes an attack not including the creature that
marked it</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Opportunity attacks are <strong>not</strong>made when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A creature is pulled, pushed, or slid past an enemy</p>
</li>
<li><p>A creature teleports</p>
</li>
<li><p>Throwing a creature</p>
</li>
<li><p>A creature flies, not of its own volition, past/over another</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Party:</strong>A group of two or more adventurers.

<strong>Petrify:</strong>A petrified creature is turned to stone. It is considered to
be unconscious, and is oblivious to events around it. It does not age,
and gains resist 40 to all damage.

<strong>Phasing:</strong>A creature that is phasing can pass through solid objects
such as walls. A phasing creature cannot pick up or hold items unless
those items are also phasing. All items worn by a creature that becomes
phasing also become phasing. A phasing creature deals half damage in
melee and unarmed attacks to creatures that are not phasing.</p>

<p><strong>Prone:</strong>A creature lying down is considered to be prone. A character
can drop prone as a minor action. A prone creature:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Grants combat advantage to melee attacks,</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gains a +2 bonus to defenses against ranged attacks</p>
</li>
<li><p>Takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Pull:</strong>When a creature or object is pulled, it is moved the designated
number of spaces in a straight line towards the creature that is pulling
it.

<strong>Push:</strong>When a creature or object is pushed, it is moved the designated
number of spaces in a straight line away from the creature that is
pushing it.

<strong>Range:</strong>For ranged attacks, your range is equal to 2 your Ranged
modifier. This is the maximum amount of squares you can hit someone with
a ranged attack from. For spells, the range is equal to 2 times the
governing school.</p>

<p><strong>Ready an Action:</strong>A character can choose to ready an action, or wait
to initiate an action until a trigger occurs. For example, Character A
can wait to strike until Character B enters a certain square, or makes
an attack. Readying an action costs the action being readied (readying a
standard action takes that standard action, etc.). If the trigger does
not occur (Character B never enters the specified square or makes an
attack), than the action is lost.

<strong>Reflex:</strong>A creature’s defense used to dodge traps, arrows, dragon’s
fire, and similar hazards.

<strong>Resistances:</strong>If a character has resistance to one type of damage,
they subtract their resistance from damage of that type. For example, if
a character has resist 5 fire, and they take 6 fire damage, they would
only take one point of damage. If they take 5 or less points, they
instead take no damage. If an attack deals more than one type of damage,
a creature must be resistant to all damage types in order to resist
damage. 

<strong>Resting:</strong>A short rest is necessary between fights, or after
travelling for an extended period of time so that characters can catch
their breaths. Some effects end “at the end of the encounter” or reset
“after a short rest”. A short rest is anywhere from five to fifteen
minutes long.
 An extended rest is necessary at the end of each day. This is when
characters eat, sleep, share stories about the day, and, in general,
rest up for the ensuing adventures. Many powers and abilities reset at
an extended rest.
 After an extended rest, characters emerge with full hit points, magic
points, fortune points, and Fortune points. Only one extended rest may
be taken in one 24-hour period. An extended rest is at least six hours
long.

<strong>Restoration:</strong>Restoration is the school of magic devoted to protecting
and healing creatures in need. Masters of Restoration have been known to
bring those thought to be dead back to life.

<strong>Restrained:</strong>A restrained creature cannot move, fly, shift, or
teleport, but can be subjected to forced movement.
<strong>Run:</strong>A character can use a move action to run, moving its movement +</p>
<ol>
<li>Doing so results in the creature granting combat advantage, and
taking a negative 2 to all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

<strong>Save ends:</strong> See saving throw. 

<strong>Saving Throws:</strong>Many conditions imposed by monsters are seen with the
notation (save ends) after them. This means that the condition lasts
until a successful saving throw is made. Each character can make one
saving throw against each effect they are suffering from at the end of
their respective turns. No actions may be taken after the saving throw
is made. A saving throw is made by rolling a d20. An eleven or higher is
considered a success.<strong>**Fear saving throws work similarly. A fear
saving throw may be required by the GM in order to act or avoid fleeing.
These operate in the same way as a normal saving throw, except the
difficulty is set by the GM, and the player adds their character’s
Discipline modifier to the roll. GMs may allow/require these saving
throws for fear to be made at the beginning of a turn, instead of the
end.

</strong>Shift:<strong>When a creature shifts, it moves one square as a move action.
This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

</strong>Sleeping:<strong>A sleeping creature is considered to be unconscious and
helpless, but if the sleep is natural (not magical in origin) the
creature immediately awakens upon taking damage. A sleeping creature
takes a -5 penalty to perception checks.

</strong>Slide:<strong>When a creature or object is slid, it is moved the designated
number of spaces in a straight line in any direction.

</strong>Slowed:**A slowed creature is considered to have a movement of two.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Square:</strong>A square presented on a standard grid map dictates how far a
character can make. A standard square is considered to be five feet in
length, width, and, as applicable, height.

<strong>Stunned:</strong>A stunned character can take no actions, including
opportunity attacks and free actions, and is unable to sustain any
powers or effects. A stunned creature grants combat advantage and cannot
flank.

<strong>Surprised:</strong>Surprised creatures grant combat advantage. A creature is
surprised if it doesn&#39;t have enough time to prepare for an attack, or if
it doesn’t know from what direction an attack will come. An invisible
attacker is surprising its target only if the target cannot hear, feel,
or otherwise accurately determine the location of the attacker.
</p>
<p><strong>Sustain:</strong> Sustain: 30 means that in order to continue an effect
granted by a spell, a character must expend 30 magic points during each
turn following the turn in which the spell was initially cast. 
Sustain minor means that a character must expend his/her minor action in
order to sustain the effects of a spell each turn after the spell is
cast.</p>
<p>Sustaining as a minor action counts as the one action allotted for a
dazed creature, but sustaining (number) does not. A creature must be
conscious and able to take actions in order to sustain. Sustaining never
grants a tally.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tally Limit:</strong>The number of successes needed to gain a level in one
skill. This is equal to the modifier of that skill.

<strong>Unconscious:</strong>An unconscious creature is considered to be helpless,
and is oblivious to events around it. 

<strong>Vulnerability:</strong>If a character is vulnerable to one type of damage,
they add damage equal to the amount they are vulnerable to any damage of
that type taken. For example, if a character has vulnerable 5 fire, and
they take 6 fire damage, they would take 11 points of damage. If an
attack deals multiple types of damage, a character needs only to be
vulnerable to one type of damage for the damage to be added. If they are
vulnerable to multiple damage types, they take the vulnerability of the
damage type they are more vulnerable to.

<strong>Weakened:</strong>A weakened character deals half damage on all attacks and
spells, and restores half as many hit points with spells that heal.

<strong>Will:</strong>A character’s defense used to resist effects of domination and
other effects that target the mind.</p>
