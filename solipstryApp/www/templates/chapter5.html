  <h1 id="skill-challenges-western-">Skill Challenges {.western}</h1>
<p>Oftentimes instead of combat, adventurers will face a series of skill
challenges. A skill challenge is any situation that can be resolved by
means other than combat. These can include picking a lock, convincing a
merchant to share information or a guard to let a party pass, noticing a
trap, lifting and moving statues, or almost anything else.</p>
<p>Similar to skill challenges are logic challenges, where the players,
rather than the characters have to solve a puzzle, such as arranging
puzzle pieces a certain way, navigating a maze, solving a riddle, or
deciding which door is safe based on cryptic clues. Logic challenges can
also be combined with skill challenges for an even greater challenge.
 Typically a skill challenge requires three successes before two
failures, though the number of successes and failures can be changed to
increase or decrease the difficulty of the challenge. A failed challenge
can result in players taking damage, not receiving helpful information,
having a shortcut blocked off, engaging in an otherwise optional combat,
or any number of penalties. GMs should not include plots that cannot be
advanced if a skill challenge is failed. 

To use a skill, players roll a d20 and add in their skill modifier,
comparing the result to the difficulty level set by the GM. The table of
recommended difficulty levels for the first five levels is included
below. The formulas given can be used to calculate the difficulty for
any level of play.</p>

<hr>
<p>  <strong>Level</strong>   <strong>Easy</strong>(level +7)   <strong>Standard</strong>(level +11)   <strong>Hard</strong>(level + 15)
  1           8                    12                        16
  2           9                    13                        17
  3           10                   14                        18
  4           11                   15                        19
  5           12                   16                        20</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="leveling-up-western-">Leveling Up {.western}</h1>
<p>When you succeed with any given skill -be it by succeeding at a skill
challenge, or simply by hitting a monster with an attack, make a tally
mark in the successes column for that skill. When you gain a number of
successes for any given skill equal to that skill’s modifier, you level
up in that skill, and should make a tally in the total successes box
below this column.</p>
<p>When you accumulate ten total successes, you go up a level, and gain
five attribute points to distribute however you see fit amongst your
attributes. In addition, every level results in the acquisition of one
Talent.
 While hitting a creature with a spell counts as a success for that
school of magic, hitting multiple targets with a single spell only
counts as one success. However, even if a spell targets multiple
creatures, you need only hit one for it to count as a success.</p>
<p>Neither skills nor total levels can increase in combat, so the effects
of these occur immediately after combat is resolved, or at the end of a
session, at the GMs discretion. Players should still make tallies during
combat, but the effects from leveling will not occur until afterward.
 A success in light or heavy armor is gained when a character is hit by
an attack while wearing the appropriate type of armor. This reflects the
character’s ability to learn to dodge attacks in light armor, or how to
take a hit while wearing heavy armor.</p>
<h1 id="enemies-western-">Enemies {.western}</h1>

<p>Included are the five classes of monster, with stats appropriate for a
beginning party. As players level up, so too will monsters need to
evolve. Under the (level up) section is advice to best scale the
monsters with your players. This may need to be altered based on a
specific party. This will require some experimentation, but following
the guidelines in terms of order and changing with moderation
(increasing hitpoints by 20 and not 80) should maintain balance.</p>

<p>When creating a monster, think of what the monster would be doing to
impose certain effects. For example, if a monster slows its prey, does
it do so by snaring its prey’s feet with roots, by burdening them with
rocks, or freezing them? This not only helps create better, more vivid
monsters, it also helps solve arguments about what actions are allowed
based on the cause of the effect. (If a creature is slowed because it is
frozen, it probably cannot fly either. However, if the cause is
something on the ground, getting above the ground may help end the
condition.)</p>
<p>The effects listed above can be applied as often as possible, at a GM’s
discretion. Typically effects are either at will (can be used on every
attack), once per encounter, or on a recharge. To recharge, a d6 is
rolled at the end of a monster’s turn. If one of the allowed numbers is
rolled, the power recharges. A powerful attack may only recharge on a 6,
a weaker one may recharge on a 2 or higher. This is also at a GM’s
discretion.</p>
<p>GM’s should try to challenge their characters without making every fight
feel as though it is a hopeless death match. This balance is obtained
through practice and player feedback.</p>

<h1 id="campaign-settings-western-align-left-style-font-weight-normal-widows-1-page-break-before-always-">Campaign Settings {.western align=&quot;LEFT&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: normal; widows: 1; page-break-before: always&quot;}</h1>
<p><em>**</em>Solipstry is intended to be an open gaming system, allowing you to
implement a constant set of rules across a variety of campaign settings.
The beauty of this is that once a group is familiarized with the rules,
the can jump into play immediately, whether they are in a deep-sea
campaign where everyone plays as mermaids, a post-apocalyptic wasteland
where they are fighting off mutant creatures and trying to find their
promised land, or a deep-sea, post-apocalyptic mermaids-gone-nuclear
campaign. The depth, scope, and strangeness of worlds you create is
limited only by your imagination.</p>
<p>However, for many GMs and players, a certain genre is most comfortable,
and it can be hard to break into new genres. The creators experienced
this first-hand in trying to incorporate varied flavor and examples
throughout the book. Inevitably though, there are some viable, some
strange, and some fairly common worlds that are simply under-represented
heretofore in the book. With this in mind, we&#39;ve provided some
flavor-heavy campaign setting examples.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that these, like all things in Solipstry, are
intended to be edited as a GM sees fit, and are by no means set rules
for campaign settings. They are merely illustrative examples meant to
get GMs thinking about all of the wacky, wonderful, horrible, and
strange places they would like to send their players.</p>
<p><img src="Solipstry_html_m4b1ab43c.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>You&#39;ve decided, as a GM, to run a campaign in a world of candy-filled
and themed fun and games. Your players, apprehensive but willing, roll
up a couple of spunky children (or maybe gingerbread people if you
prefer) to navigate this sticky-sweet world. They go talk to Granny
Pecan, who sends them on a mission to Gloop, the syrup monster over in
the Syrup Bog. When there, they are to retrieve her best pie tin, which
Gloop seems to have borrowed without intent to return, probably for
something rather unsavory.<img src="Solipstry_html_m238e19eb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Granny Pecan&#39;s Lollipop Shield</p>
<p>Granny Pecan is kind enough to give the children some things she has
sitting around which should help them in navigating the more perilous
parts of the land. Shirley Scrumptious was given a giant chocolate
fountain pen (which everyone knows is mightier than a sword), a modified
lollipop shield, and peanut brittle armor. As such, Shirley would use
the rules for a heavy weapon, shield, and heavy armor.</p>
<p>Shirley&#39;s best friend, Paulie Praline, was given made from sheets of
thin, rolled, fruit-flavored snacks. He uses no shield, instead carrying
a utility belt of various candies such as carbonated sugar crystals,
which cause explosions, and tubes of sour candy powder, which can cause
blindness.</p>
<p>This amounts to light armor and spell-casting, with a material
component. Paulie would probably want to start studying chemistry and
the making of candy to be able to make his own candies, and Paulie and
the GM should sit down to determine which spells in the list can be
justified as performable with candies. If the pool gets too limited, it
is likely they could create a couple of their own as well.</p>
<p>Probably, while Paulie and the GM are discussing spells, they would want
to go over renaming some skills to be more in line with the delicious
theme this world is created around. For example, Alchemy would probably
become candy making. Since they are children, knowledge might become
&quot;schooling&quot; or some such.</p>


<p>~<strong>Citadel North</strong>~</p>
<p>The eternal night is illuminated only by vagrants&#39; fires, the
streetlights long having been shattered. The streets constantly reek of
gasoline. Despite the overwhelming advances in technology, nothing could
be done to clear up the perpetually dark skies that loomed overhead, a
constant reminder of the previous generation’s tremendous breakthroughs
in industry. Even now, smog emits from one lone factory, mocking the
scientists’ work for sunlight.</p>
<p>Some say that the remnants of dark, ancient magic are the key to
restoring nature’s power, but those few are rarely heard from for very
long. It is thought that the Legion, those officers of order who patrol
these desolate streets, removes these individuals, perhaps for their
knowledge, and perhaps for their silence. But those who are close to the
Legion know that the corruption of those few that function as government
over The City doesn’t quite stem to that level.</p>
<p>This is The City. It had another name once, long ago, but it was lost
with the privacy of its citizens. Each citizen is permitted (and
mandated by law) to carry their access card with them wherever they go.
This access card states a citizen’s identity, determines what buildings
and infrastructure a citizen has access to, level of care upon
hospitalization, managers credit transactions, and, of course, makes it
oh so very easy for agents of the Legion to track the movements and
locations of those whom they protect.</p>
<p>Long since bankrupt, the city is completely independent from the rest of
the land. Travel is limited–any cars have long since been stripped for
metal, and only the Legion has hover cars, short range vehicles whose
movements are very strictly watched.</p>
<p>Recently, Cybernetic Modification, endearingly called CyMod by those
rich enough to afford it has swept through the barren city. Agents of
the Legion were among the first to gain access to this luxury, but more
and more denizens claimed the chance to change their genetic makeup.
Reactions were as varied as the modifications–Those who improved their
eyesight or ability to taste often resorted to pain killers to dull the
sharp and throbbing pains which had become constant, while those who
strengthened their skeletons or enhanced their lungs turned to
self-inflicted injuries and uppers, just to feel something again.</p>
<p>Those too poor for CyMod didn’t see these downsides. They saw the
future, and they smelt salvation. And they weren’t getting their fair
cut. Riots have become increasingly common in The City, along with
rampages from CyMod patients whose brains haven’t taken the modification
perfectly. The Legion has had their hands full.</p>

<p>Sharlem’s Quarry</p>
<p>Tumbleweed rolls in. This is no man’s land. The sheriff’s word was law,
once, when every man knew his neighbor, could trust the next man, and
disagreements were settled with fistfights or duels at high noon, under
the shadows of the circling pterodactyls.</p>
<p>Bar fights broke out, sure, folks got rowdy. But at the end of the day,
the town of Sharlem’s Quarry was a family. A haven. Visitors checked
their weapons at the door, and permanent residents worked their way into
the sheriff’s trust. The sheriff, a mustached man by the name of Sam
Longrinne, led a group of rangers out to ensure that bandits and raptors
kept their distance, but both grew closer daily. Travel was limited,
with horses being the favored prey of the raptors that claimed the
desertous land, but the stables were guarded, just inside the city’s
gates</p>
<p>Doc Herman knew every family, from birth to death, and everyone, save
father Broderick, held multiple jobs. Owen and Maylin Wright farmed
cattle, sure, but they also dug wells for any family who wanted one.
Willy Regburn, the bartender also taught history to the school kids.
Almost no man held but one job, and every family was devoted to helping
the house’s head. If the house head dies, the sons move away, leaving
any daughters with a chance of marrying, owning land and staying afloat.
They’ll work as ranch hands or miners. Every man had his neighbor’s
back. Debts, grudges, and quarrels were dropped on Sunday and resumed on
Monday–unless some greater disaster or cause brought about a need for
greater co-operation. If the town needed solidarity, the residents of
Sharlem’s Quarry would drop their personal feuds for the good of the
community.</p>
<p>But that was before the bounty hunters rolled in. Spitting, rowdy,
itching for a fight. They roughed up anyone who stood in their way,
marking this town as their own, turning it into a violent war zone. They
killed the rangers, stopping the patrols. The bandits learned to steer
clear, but the raptors, they had fair game through the town. These days,
the law was defined as the man with the biggest gun.</p>

<p>Reinfeld’s Folly</p>
<p>Anchors up, <em>The Betrothed</em>left the coast, merrily bobbing with the
gentle pushes of the breeze. Men lined the hold, rowing heartily until
the wind died down. The burners were kept warm, the cannons loaded.
Grunting and chanting a haunting song, the crew moved about the ship and
raised their black sail. The captain, a six-foot mountain of a man by
the name of Montrussel who was mostly blunderbuss and beard, spat as he
stared over the side. 30,000 feet below, he could barely make out the
distant shapes of the land below through his one good eye. Behind him, a
port remained neutral, Trumbark, open to all traders, friendly to those
who didn’t ask questions. He knew his men were near revolt; he’d lost
two of his crew at Trumbark. He yelled up the topmast to Hackin’ Tad,
warning him that they’d better find prey ere the sun rose. A cough
answered, and the gaunt man slid down the pole, eagerly reporting that
there was a ship to the north. 
 Two years ago, that was a rare occurrence. But now, pirates like
Montrussel’s Betrothed owned these skies, fighting each other for the
rare trader that still dared to roam the free space. Embargos, bounties,
and infiltrators were evaded, ignored, and killed. There was nothing to
quell the pirate threat. That’s not to say there were no pirate hunters.
But no matter what flag one flew, they marked themselves a target. Honor
among thieves was a concept that had been left below, under the nether.</p>
