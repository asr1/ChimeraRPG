<h1 id="-introduction-"><strong>Introduction</strong>:</h1>
<p><strong>What is Solipstry?</strong></p>
<p>If Solipsism is the belief that the entire world exists only in your
mind, then Solipstry is a set of tools used to forge that world. For
those unfamiliar with the concept of roleplaying games, I want to
welcome to you a world of new experiences. A place where dreams are
brought to life, stories are crafted, and wondrous creations are the
norm. I want to invite you to your workshop.</p>
<p>If this is your first experience with an RPG, allow me to acquaint you
with some of the products this toolset can craft. Worlds where
adventures seek fame, glory, and the heads of famous beasts. Stories of
pirates pillaging the Six Nations and inadvertently starting a
revolution. Legends of cyber hackers travelling through time to solve
the world’s greatest mysteries. Because Solipstry doesn’t confine itself
to one genre, any story you can dream of can be created and tuned to
your desire. Nothing is set in stone; everything here can be adjusted or
discarded, providing everyone at the table is using the same set of
rules.</p>
<p><strong>Effective vs. Actual:</strong> Effective scores can be any number, even those
smaller than zero or greater than 100. These numbers are almost always
used for calculating modifiers, prerequisites, etc. If you take a talent
that has STR 40 as a prerequisite, and lose your +5 STR amulet, lowering
your Strength to 38, you cannot benefit from that talent. Actual scores
are used to determine tally limits.</p>
<p>Think of RPGs as a childhood game of Cops and Robbers. It’s a lot of fun
until the disputes arise—Who got hit, who dodged the bullets, who ran
out of ammo—That’s where Solipstry comes in. With simple rules, this
toolset removes the doubt, and removes the dispute. Suppose you want a
world where no is limited to one death, but has a number of clones, each
to be filled with the previous clone’s memory upon death. That’s
perfectly acceptable—as long as everyone who’s playing is aware of this.
Similarly, if, instead of cops and robbers, the game becomes
were-alligators and space troopers, with a few simple adjustments (space
troopers are probably using something more advanced than a simple six
shooter, for example) all problems disappear.</p>
<p>Those of you who are more familiar with roleplaying games will notice
some unusual choices present in Solipstry. While we stick to a d20
system with occasional d100 that is familiar to veterans, several things
stick out. Experience points are missing. Gaining experience from
monsters takes time to calculate and track from session to sessions.
This removes time you could actually be playing. Experience from quests
is arbitrary at best. In Solipstry, characters level up based on how
they use their skills: ranks in skills improve as characters use them.
The less familiar they are with the skill, the faster they level up.
Actually, levelling up is a bit of a misnomer, as we’ve removed all
level dependence from the system as well. This means (among other
things) that there is no level cap. The result is a system that is
clean, efficient, and easy for new players to learn.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem radical at first, don’t think of them as
something entirely foreign. Think of them like seeing a girl you went to
high school with stripping. Once you get over the initial awkwardness,
you find you still have a lot in common, albeit with a little more
sexual tension.</p>
<p>With the freedom Solipstry allows, you can create your dream story.
Whatever genre, style, or blend you desire can be crafted. The rules are
flexible enough to allow for even the craziest of ideas, but crunchy
enough to cover every common (and a few unexpected) situations. If
you’re looking to play in a world that isn’t generic enough to have its
own specialized system, take this for a ride. The world’s all in your
mind. We just help keep it straight.</p>
<p><strong>Materials Needed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A table. A large, flat place to play where everyone can clearly see
the map is essential.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dice. A complete set of dice includes 1d20, 1d12, 2d10 (one
percentile or different color) 1d8, 1d6, and 1d4. (See sidebar on
dice notation below).</p>
</li>
<li><p>People. A typical group consists of five players and one GM. While
you can play with any number of players, parties smaller than three
tend to last only briefly in combat and parties greater than six
tend to find distractions that detract from gameplay.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A map. A map can be as simple as grid sheet with 1-inch squares to
mark positions, especially in combat. Consider a map that can be
marked on, so that a playing field or obstacles can be drawn in.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Creature Markers. Being able to differentiate between characters is
important, especially in combat. Miniatures from other games can
work, or even simple objects such as buttons, washers, or coins.
Make sure both players and monsters can be easily identified.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Character sheets and pencils. Everyone needs to be able to see their
stats and mark magic/hit point usage. The GM also needs to track
initiative and monster hit points.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A certain frame of mind. As a player, one must be willing to act and
put his/her mind in the place of the character’s mind. As a GM, it
is important to note that any rule that seems out of place can be
modified or ignored, as long as all players clearly understand all
of the rules before gameplay begins. For example, if the setting of
a world is very realistic, a GM may choose to eradicate all of the
skills pertaining to magic. None of these rules are meant to be set
in stone, but rather taken as suggestions. Just make sure everyone
is clear on rules before gameplay begins.</p>
<p><strong>Dice Notation</strong>: A common notation seen in this guide is 3d10,
where the lowercase “d” indicates that a die is being rolled, the
number immediately following indicates the sides on that die, and
the number preceding is the number of dice being rolled. If no
number proceeds, then a single die is being rolled. In the previous
example, 3d10, three ten-sided dice are being rolled, resulting in a
total between 3 and 30, inclusive.</p>
<p>A d100 roll can be simulated with 2d10, one for the tens place, and
one for the ones place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="roleplaying">Roleplaying</h1>
<p>Your first time creating a character can seem daunting, but it
essentially comes down to two parts, the mechanical and the flavorful.
Mechanical is all the numbers that affect gameplay directly like
defenses and hit points. The flavorful elements are what makes your
character… Well, a character. It gives it things like height,
background, an intense dislike of dogs, a constant yearning for grilled
cheese sandwiches, and such. Without these characteristics, all you have
is a piece of paper with numbers.
 Creating a semi-functional being out of the ether with only your mind
to help you can seem a bit challenging. If you’re new to roleplaying,
it’s generally a good and effective idea to model your character’s
personality off yourself or someone you know. Maybe your alien cave
explorer is exactly like your drunken roommate freshman year of college,
down to lighting people’s sheets on fire and leaving pizza under his bed
for luck.</p>
<p>Or, maybe not. It can be equally effective to ask yourself questions
about your character’s likes and dislikes. How does he feel about magic?
Technology? Violence? His great-aunt? Crackers in his soup? Alligator
boots? Does he prefer using force, logic and intellect, or charisma and
charm to solve his problems? What’s his preferred mode of transport?
Space freighter, boat, horse, walking, frolicking, dog-sled? Even for
experienced roleplayers, these kinds of questions can help flesh out a
character, especially in a strange new environment. Knowing the details
of your character can also help a GM create interesting plot points
tailored to your character, so be sure to keep your GM updated on any
major details.</p>
<p><strong>Percents:</strong> Sometimes, a number between one and one hundred will need
to be generated. Instead of obtaining a d100, many players prefer to
roll 2d10, denoting one (usually a different color, or labeled 10, 20,
etc. (as opposed to 1, 2, etc.)) as the tens place, and one as the ones
place.</p>
<h1 id="character-creation-">Character Creation </h1>
<p>Now that your character has a personality and background, the assignment
of mechanical aspects can commence.</p>
<p><strong>1. Assign Attributes</strong></p>
<p>Use one of the three arrays, or roll for your stats by rolling 3d10 and
rerolling any ones or twos until they show a value of three or greater.
For more information on assigning attributes, see page 14. The three
arrays you can use are</p>
<p>​A) 30 30 20 20 20 20 10 10</p>
<p>​B) 30 30 30 20 20 10 10 10</p>
<p>​C) 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20</p>
<p>These numbers represent actual scores, which can be from 9-100.
Calculate any penalties or bonuses, and use these numbers to calculate
your effective score.</p>
<p><strong>2. Choose your skills</strong></p>
<p>Skills determine everything in Solipstry. Select 5 skills to be your
starter skills. These skills start at 25. All other skills are
considered secondary skills, and start at 10.</p>
<p>After you decide which skills will start with a value of 10, and which
will start with a value of 25, add each governing attribute’s modifier
to the skill total. This will determine your actual skill level. More
information can be found on page 25.</p>
<p><strong>3. Choose a race</strong></p>
<p>Choose a race and size and apply any applicable racial bonuses. Some
races may receive special bonuses, such as the ability to see in the
dark. For more information, see page 21.</p>
<p><strong>Currency:</strong>Throughout this guide, we will refer to all currency as
“gold”. Depending on the campaign, currency could be measured in
dollars, gold, doubloons, credits, animal hide, the barter system, or
just about anything else. Speak with your GM about the appropriate
currency for your campaign.</p>
<p><strong>4. Get equipment</strong></p>
<p>Characters generally start with one weapon, armor, and 100 gold to buy
an additional weapon, a shield, and ammunition. Most ranged weapons come
with ten pieces of ammunition, varying upon the GM. Typically,
characters start with a torch or flashlight, 50 feet of rope, and three
day’s rations.</p>
<p>Note: some campaigns may require characters to start with less, or even
no equipment. Talk with your GM to see what is appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>5. Apply any item bonuses or penalties</strong></p>
<p>These might come from a magic pendant or amulet, or from biokinetic
armor that you wear. 
 A character in heavy armor takes a penalty to Speed, Acrobatics
Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Endurance (as it relates to
physical exercise), Escape, Sleight of Hand, Restoration, and Stealth
equal to (10 - Heavy Armor skill modifier).
 A character in light armor or conjured armor takes no penalties from
the light or conjured armor.
 Note that characters trained in Heavy Armor (page 31) have reduced
penalties. 
 These bonuses and penalties determine your effective score.</p>
<p><strong>6. Determine derived traits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your movement is equal to three plus your Speed modifier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your hit points are equal to 1.5 times your Constitution score.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your total amount of Magic is equal to five times your Wisdom score.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your Magic regeneration rate is equal to your Intelligence score.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your Fortune Points are equal to your Luck modifier, or your Luck
score divided by 10.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your Initiative bonus is equal to your Speed modifier plus any
Talent or item bonuses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You gain Enlightment Points equal to your Enlightenment score.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your range (for use with non-melee attacks and spells) is equal to 2
times your modifier for the appropriate skill (Ranged, Destruction,
etc.). This represents not necessarily the limit of the device being
thrown/fired, but rather the ability of the shooter to aim
accurately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You gain a number of languages equal to your Language modifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Determine defenses</strong></p>
<p>Characters have four defenses: Armor Class (AC), Fortitude, Reflex, and
Will.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AC is calculated two different ways, depending on if the character
is wearing heavy armor or light armor. A character must be entirely
in either heavy or light armor. Mismatching is not allowed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Heavy armor AC is equal to 12 + the character’s Heavy Armor
modifier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>AC for characters wearing light armor is equal to 7 + the higher
of the character’s Speed or Dexterity modifier + the character’s
Light Armor modifier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you wield a shield in one hand, gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +
5 bonus to Block (the skill).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fortitude is equal to 10 + a character’s Constitution modifier</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reflex for characters in heavy armor is equal to the higher of the
character’s Speed or Dexterity modifier + Heavy Armor modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflex for characters in light armor is equal to 5 + the higher
of the character’s Speed or Dexterity modifier + Light Armor
modifier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Will is equal to 10 + a character’s Wisdom modifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on defenses, see page 43.</p>
<p><strong>8. Choose Spells and Truths</strong></p>
<p>You may learn one spell per modifier in each school of magic. For
example, if you have a score of 15 in Destruction and 20 in Alteration,
you may learn one Destruction spell and two Alteration spells (Or up to
three metamagic spells). If you do not like a spell, you may choose to
learn a different one in its place each time you level up. Note that if
a spell has a prerequisite, you must still be trained in the
prerequisite to use that spell. Learning a higher version of a spell
does not prohibit you from using a lower version. See page 43<strong><strong>for a
list of spells sorted by schools, or page 55 for all spells and their
effects. Some GMs may further limit or lessen the restrictions on the
number of spells you can change at each level, but the limit outlined
here is one per level. You may also replace Talents in a similar
manner.
You learn Truths as you level up in Enlightenment. See page 30</strong></strong>for
more information.</p>
<p><strong>Perks**</strong>:**Some attributes, as well as some skills, grant characters
benefits for achieving milestones in those areas. These benefits are
marked with a table of the skill required, and the benefit rewarded,
where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>9. Choose Talents</strong></p>
<p>You gain one Talent at character creation and an additional Talent every
level after this. A list of Talents can be found on page 47.</p>
<h2 id="attributes-western-">Attributes </h2>
<p>These are guidelines that represent examples of what a person with these
attributes may act/look like. These are not definitive, and are meant to
help with roleplaying purposes. Many adventurers start at a young age,
and hence have stats that may be lower than “an average human”. These
stats improve not only due to practice, but also due to aging. Keep in
mind that these stats are based off of surviving adventurers, so while a
person with a Strength of 10 may be considered weak amongst adventurers,
they may still be one of the stronger people in their village. Many
human adventurers start adventuring in their late teens, although some
have started earlier, and many have started later, often to unfortunate
ends. <strong>The attributes are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Charisma (CHA)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Constitution (CON)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intelligence (INT)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck (LCK)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speed (SPD)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strength (STR)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wisdom (WIS)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rolling Under Luck:
</strong>There are times when players will take an action whose result can only
be determined by their in game luck score. Situations like: The player
set a trap. Is it triggered? Character murdered someone. Did they leave
any traceable clues? More importantly, did the detective find any? Or
know what they mean?</p>
<p>Whenever a situation like this arises, the player should roll a d100 and
trying to get their luck score or lower. This would be an attribute
check, and success would not result in a tally.</p>
<p><strong>Charisma (CHA)</strong>
 Charisma dictates how others perceive you, and how much they like you.
It controls your ability to interact with, manipulate, and otherwise
communicate with individuals.

</li>
<li><p>A Constitution of 100 would only be found on someone who has been
running many miles each day for their entire life. This person can
literally fight or run for weeks, and stops only to eat or sleep,
which they can go for days without doing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong></p>
<p>Dexterity governs your ability to move quickly and silently, as well as

try. This person would always land on their feet, and is capable of
such astounding acts as walking across the very surface of water.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intelligence (INT)</strong></p>
<p>Intelligence determines how quickly a character learns new concepts and
governs all knowledge-based skills. Your Intelligence score is also
equal to the magic points you regain each round</p>
<p><strong>Skills governed</strong>: Chemistry, Craft/Smith, Engineering, Knowledge,

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Luck (LCK)</strong> Luck controls the number of Fortune points characters
get, as well as less specific bonuses, such as better loot, or less
random encounters, that a GM might grant to characters with high Luck. A
low Luck may result in penalties as well. Luck divided by 10 is the
number of Fortune points per day a character starts with. For more
information about Fortune points, see page 45. Luck is also used to
decide ties between characters, if they roll equally in opposing checks,
or is they roll the same initiative and have the same modifier, for
example.<strong>Skills governed:</strong> Luck doesn’t govern any skills.</p>
<p><strong>Lifting:</strong>To lift an object, make an athletics check and multiply by
10 (or 5 for Kg). This represents how many pounds you can lift (but not
carry for a long time</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A person with a Luck of 10 feels the world is out to get them.
Haunted by bad luck and terrible fortune, this person can never seem
to catch a break.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person with a Luck of 20 has average luck. Nothing particularly
amazing happens to them, nor does anything particularly bad happen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person with a Luck of 30 may occasionally find a spare coin along
the side of the road, or an uneaten meal someone unintentionally
discarded.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person with a Luck of 40 often finds lethal traps that happen not
to spring, or miss by inches.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person with a Luck of 50 is often well off, and usually not
through any work of their own. They seem to always be in the right
place at the right time, speaking to the right people, and taking
the correct paths.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A person with a Luck of 60 is known for their luck. Shots miss them
by inches; police just barely miss their illegal goods.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Luck of 70 indicates a particularly lucky person, someone who
doesn&#39;t mind taking a risk or gamble because things just tend to
happen their way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Someone with a Luck of 80 can count on good fortune to carry them
through a situation they shouldn&#39;t be carried through. This person
cares little for odds, as they rarely reflect reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>People with Luck of 90 tend to be kicked out of casinos for cheating. It
is sometimes unfortunate just how lucky these people are. They find it
hard to find partners for card games, but life seems to <em>work</em> for this
person.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Luck of 100 is rare, and the few beings who have possessed it were
rumored to bend the very reality of the world around them to their
whims. Every desire would simply fall in their laps, and they never
guessed incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Speed (SPD)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck:</strong>
The benefits of raising Luck as an attribute depend largely on the GM.
GMs might want to consider rewarding lucky characters with extra
treasure, an ambush round in a battle, or a chance to spot an enemy
before the rest of the party. Alternatively, characters with very low
Luck can be punished (a flock of birds causes a shot to miss, or give
away a position). Luck should not determine major actions, nor should
any character feel persecuted for choosing a low Luck score. Generally,
a GM should consider Luck on small or minor actions that do not
dramatically affect gameplay.
 GMs may consider rewarding players with extra Fortune points for good
roleplaying, or similar behavior. Alternatively, a karma system could be
used, where characters are granted Fortune points for good actions, and
are penalized with the removal of Fortune points for bad or evil
choices.</p>
<p>Speed controls total movement (in squares), how quickly you can react in
a combat setting, and the number of actions you get in a round.</p>
<p><strong>Skills governed:</strong> Block.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2 + (Speed/10) = number of squares you can move with one move action</p>
</li>
<li><p>Speed / 10 = initiative modifier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The adventurer with the Speed of 10 is usually the slowest, drawing
his weapon last, and struggling to catch up to his comrades.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The adventurer with a Speed of 20 is slow to act, slow to chase, and
slow to follow. In general, he is mostly just slow. This is an
average person (usually encumbered by the weights of equipment).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Speed of 30 indicates someone who can keep pace with most people,
but certainly isn’t setting records.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Speed of 40 will be found at the person who is leading most

<p><strong>Strength (STR)</strong></p>
<p>Strength controls accuracy and damage in combat. Your Strength score
also determines how much equipment you can carry with you.</p>
<p><strong>Skills governed:</strong> Athletics, Melee Weapon and Unarmed Combat</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strength x 3 = Max load you can carry at full movement</p>

what they need to, move what they must, and hit hard enough to
count.</p>

<p>Adventurers can carry approximately 4 pounds for each score they have in
Strength, and throw 9/10 of that. The table below should give the
approximate values for each range. Note that the amount an adventurer
can lift for a short duration is greater than the amount that they can
carry long distances, and it is these carrying values that are displayed
in the table. For simply lifting an object, an athletics check is
usually required. GMs may apply additional penalties for throwing large
or cumbersome items.</p>

<p><strong>Wisdom (WIS)</strong></p>
<p>Wisdom controls magic usage, as well as how easily your character can
figure out logic puzzles.</p>
<p>Skills governed: Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Discipline, Heal,
Perception, Enlightenment , Restoration, and Sense Motive.</p>
<ul>
<li>5x Wisdom score = total magic points</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>When a person with a Wisdom of 10 gets an idea, it is almost
impossible to get them to change their mind, no matter how foolish
the notion. Logic has little place in their mind, and if they hear
something they will be most inclined to believe it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Wisdom of 20 symbolizes someone who simply refuses to listen to
logic, and is quite gullible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Wisdom of 30 indicates a rash, thickheaded person with a quick
temper who will believe some poorly-constructed lies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Wisdom of 40 indicates someone who isn’t too quick to anger or
judge a situation or person, and will fall for only the most
cleverly planned lies.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Wisdom of 50 can be found on a planning person, one who examines
several angles before forming a plan.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Someone with a Wisdom of 60 can rationally examine most situations
with a respectable amount of objectivity, and is rarely fooled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Wisdom of 70 shows a person who is capable of separating emotion
from facts, and often retains a clear, focused, mind.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People with a Wisdom of 80 are often sought after for advice. They
can see through most lies and are adept at problem solving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Few people have a Wisdom of 90. These few rarely even need to listen
to arguments before fairly evaluating a situation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only a small handful of adventurers have obtained a Wisdom of 100.

answers to solutions, sensing traps, and recognizing problems faster

<h2 id="races-western-align-left-style-widows-1-page-break-before-always-">Races</h2>
<p><strong>Choose a size:</strong></p>
<p>Small (2’11 - 4’10) -**A small creature gains a +1 bonus to its Reflex
defense, but must use one damage die smaller for their weapon of choice.
This penalty is due to smaller creatures having smaller hands, and being
unable to wield large weapons. Small creatures also gain a +5 bonus to
the stealth skill. Two allied small creatures can stand, travel, and
fight in one 5 foot by 5 foot square. Examples of small creatures
include Gnomes and Leprechauns.</p>
<p><strong>Medium (4’11”- 6’5”)</strong>- A medium creature gains no bonuses and suffers
from no penalties due to size. A medium sized creature occupies one 5
foot by 5 foot square. Examples of medium creatures include Humans and
Elves.</p>
<p><strong>Large (6’6” - 8’6&quot;) -</strong>A large creature suffers from a -1 penalty to
its Reflex defense, but can use a weapon that is one damage die higher
than they could normally use. Large creatures are easier to hit, and
have a hard time dodging projectiles. A large creature takes a –5
penalty to the stealth skill. A large sized creature occupies one 5 foot
by 5 foot square. Examples of large creatures include giants and
tree-people.</p>
<p><strong>Flight:</strong>Some players may want to create a character with flight.
While there are no rules outlined here for flight, here are some
guidelines so as to not overpower a character: A GM could make a flight
skill based off of Speed, allowing a character to fly a number of
squares equal to their Flight modifier, landing at the end of the
flight, or, when obtaining a high Flight score, gaining hover, the
ability to remain flying at the end of a turn. Alternatively, a GM may
rule that a character can’t fly until x level, due to wings not
maturing, or any other in-game reason. A GM may consider weight
restrictions when flying.</p>
<p><strong>Rules for Race Creation:</strong>Any race can be used, from aliens to
animals, as long as your GM approves. Some races may have additional
benefits or penalties. For example, one GM may rule that a robot doesn’t
need to breathe, but can’t use the Enlightenment skill. Another GM may
add an aversion to water, and say that the religious figure must be the
robot’s creator, or a famous robot or cyborg.</p>
<p>Additionally, if a player wants to play an angel, one GM might say that
the player may only choose from Acrobatics, Persuade, Light armor and
Enlightenment in the form of religion, while another GM might say that
the player may choose any skills except Sleight of Hand, but must pick
Enlightenment as a starter skill. 
 A vampire race may have (depending on GM) a weakness to fire, silver,
crosses and garlic, be unable to be exposed to direct sunlight, cross
running water, or enter a house uninvited. They may also be required to
sleep in a coffin containing soil from the vampire’s homeland each
night. As with all restrictions and benefits, talk to your GM before
gameplay.</p>
<p>The sample characters are intended to show guidelines for what kinds of
tradeoffs are reasonable.</p>
<p>Basically, you want roughly the same number of positive and negative
alterations, and you want them to be of relatively equal magnitude. It
would be unreasonable to take a -5 to a skill for a +5 to an attribute,
for example.</p>
<p>GMs do make mistakes, and it may be necessary to retroactively correct a
homebrew that leaves a character unbalanced–either too weak or too
strong. If this happens, it is best to open a dialogue with the player,
explain how the mistake was made, and work to create a story reason that
would explain the re-balancing of the character.</p>
<p>Sample Character: Rho 3784-B
Race: Robot
Size: medium</p>
<p>STR 30
CON 20
DEX 20
INT 20
WIS 30
CHA 10
LCK 10
SPD 20</p>
<p><strong>Tradeoffs</strong>
– Cannot use magic</p>
<ul>
<li>Immune to magic drain spells and effects
– Cannot take skills in any magic school or use magic spells</li>
<li>Variety of study: Choose one extra major skill.</li>
<li>Increased focus on skills +5 to one skill.
+) Does not need to eat, drink, breathe, sleep etc.
–Vulnerable 5 to electric and water attacks.
–Takes ongoing 10 damage while submerged.
–Has the Confused condition when exposed to magnets.
–Must be oiled once a week or takes a cumulative 50% penalty to speed.
–Must spend 4 hours of inactivity per day in the sunlight, or 8 hours of
activity. Without this, has dazed condition.
+Natural Armor +2 AC</li>
</ul>
<p>The robot’s biggest bonus is its lack of need for physical necessities.
What could be overpowered is mitigated by a need to “recharge” (in this
case solar powered), which emulates sleep, and need to be oiled or have
regular maintenances performed. This acts as a kind of tether for the
character, so it cannot run off into completely desolate areas for weeks
at a time.</p>
<p>The second half of the robot is the lack of magic, which may be a common
tradeoff among characters. If a character has no connection to magic, it
follows that they would be unaffected by any effect that attempt to
manipulate that connection, for positive or negative. The additional
skills help to add balance to the character. Since magic adds bonuses
both in and out of combat, the player was given no restrictions on which
skill they can “reassign” that missed field of study into.</p>
<p>Sample character: Chad “Please call me Vlad” Dreshmire
Race: Vampire
Size: medium
STR 10
CON 10
DEX 40
INT 20
WIS 10
CHA 15
LCK 30
SPD 20</p>
<p><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong>
 •Attribute trades : +10 Dex, -10 INT
–Feed dependency
–Must drink blood every 48 hours or is dazed and Speed is reduced by 10.
If more than 7 consecutive days without blood, dies.
+Will not die of old age; for a wound to be fatal it must have fire or
holy damage, pierce the heart, or separate the head. If the vampire
would die except for these conditions, he is unconscious until he is
buried in soil for 48 consecutive hours. 
+No need to eat, breath, or sleep.
–Cannot cross running water, if touching silver, garlic or religious
symbols, take ongoing 2 damage.
–Cannot enter a home uninvited
–Vulnerable 5 holy, fire damage.
/ Doesn’t appear in mirrors</p>
<ul>
<li>+5 stealth
+5 CHA</li>
</ul>
<p>The main advantage of a vampire is the invulnerability, which is
directly mitigated by the burial clause–Once dead, the vampire relies on
someone else to bury him to be truly immortal. The major drawback is the
feed dependency, but this is mitigated by the lack of need to eat,
breathe, or sleep. The bonuses to stealth and Charisma offset the
(mostly roleplay) vulnerabilities and restrictions.</p>
<p>The attribute trading is independent from the vampirism, and also a very
common homebrew. As long as the trade is balanced (or, if unbalanced,
slightly more negative than positive), stay within limits (10-100), and
the DM is comfortable with it, all attribute trades are legal.</p>
<p>Sample character: Chyntia Altwine</p>
<p>Race: Mermaid
Size: medium</p>
<p>STR 20
CON 10
DEX 30
INT 20
WIS 10
CHA 30
LCK 20
SPD 20</p>
<p><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong>
+Can breathe under water
–Cannot breathe air</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed increases by 15 in water
–Speed decreases by 15 on land
/ Disguise has to be one of the major skills</li>
<li>Bite attack as unarmed</li>
<li>+5 to Unarmed skill
+Start with spell “scream”
–Cannot speak</li>
</ul>
<p>Some GMs or players might not be comfortable removing a character’s
ability to speak. It is generally a good idea to ensure a character has
a method of communicating with the rest of the party. This build of
mermaid would be ideal for an underwater campaign, where land-based
creatures would be unable to speak anyway.</p>

<h2 id="skills-western-style-page-break-before-always-">Skills </h2>
<p>The complete list of skills is as follows. If a skill is mentioned here
that would not fit into a campaign (such as demolitions), GMs should
feel free to exclude is, informing all players of the change.

Some GMs may rule that all characters know a common language (such as English) in addition to any other languages their character may know (such as Spanish, Demonic, or Elven). The tens place value (or the modifier) of the actual (and not effective) Language skill determines the number of languages a character is fluent in. The ones place determines how fluent they are in the next language they are learning. A score of 11 would indicate someone who has mastered one language, and can usually identify when a second is being spoken. Similarly, a score of 52 would be found one a character who knows five languages fluently, and knows basic phrases (such as asking for food) in a sixth. A score of 39 would indicate someone who can communicate easily with locals in their fourth language. Note that additional languages can be learned through Talents.

<p>4<strong>Unarmed Comba</strong></p>












<p><strong>Custom Skills</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways a GM can make a custom skill. The first is
reflavoring an existing skill. For example, in rough-and-tumble Nordic
setting, a GM might want to call the “Sleight of Hand” skill “Pillage”,
and have it based off of strength instead. Or perhaps in a high tech
world, having the Engineer skill cover all tech use is too broad, and
the GM wants to separate it into several, more specific skills. These
are minor changes that don’t significantly impact gameplay.</p>
<p>The second route a GM can make to create skills that more directly
pertain to a specific setting is by creating them from scratch. Creating
a new skill is easy. The first thing that needs to be done is decide
which Attribute will govern the skill. The modifier of that attribute
will be added to the score of the new skill. The second step is defining
tier bonuses. Each skill gets a bonus when a character has a score of
25, 50, and 75. The bonuses should be at least marginally related to the
skill in question. Look at the existing tier trees for examples. If a GM
is feeling particularly ambitious, he or she can add new Talents to
interact with the skill as well.</p>

<h2 id="equipment-western-">Equipment </h2>
<h3 id="weapons-western-align-center-style-font-weight-normal-widows-4-">Weapons </h3>
<p>In Solipstry, anything can be used as a weapon. This includes medieval
weapons, such as swords and axes, modern weapons, such as pistols and
grenades, as well as fantastical weapons, such as laser swords or
rifles. Less traditional weapons (such as a stop sign or mail box for a
large character or a lamp or a shovel for a medium sized creature) can
also be used. Depending on the GM, these nontraditional weapons may fall
under the category of improvised weapons (see below). Generally, the
distinction between regular weapon and improvised weapon is whether or
not the character intended to use (or practiced using) the weapon. As
far as weapon selection, there is no distinction between ranged and
melee weapons. 
 Note that some weapons may require fuel or ammunition to work properly.
Some GMs may choose to ignore these restrictions, and assume that
players have an unlimited supply of items necessary to operate weaponry.</p>
<h3 id="augments-western-align-center-style-font-weight-normal-widows-4-">Augments</h3>
<p>Some items have special powers. Maybe a smuggler’s blunderbuss was
cursed to glow brightly in any darkness, or a piece of armor enchanted
to resist 3 damage on every attack until it had resisted 40 damage
total. Perhaps a harpoon is fitted with a programmable chip, allowing it
to deal the last kind of damage that was dealt to its wielder. An amulet
could be found that allows its wearer to pass through walls as if they
were hanging silk sheets. All manners of items can be augmented, and the
flavor of that augment can determined by the GM based on factors like
setting and tone.
 It’s possible for items to be augmented multiple times, or for a single
augment to grant multiple effects. GMs want to be wary when handing out
augmented items, however. A trident that grants a +1 attack bonus and
deals ice damage isn’t game-breaking, but a rapier that grants +2 AC,
increases the damage die by 1, and also can cast the Permafrost spell
thrice a day might be at low levels.
 Neither fists nor improvised weapons can be augmented.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Weapons:<em>**</em></strong>Some creatures have natural weapons like claws
or fangs. These weapons typically cannot be removed. They operate off
Unarmed Combat (rather than melee) but have an increased damage die by
1.</p>
<p>Augments in your campaign</p>
<p>As mentioned, augments can come in many forms: combining tools, affixing
a chemical agent, injecting the user with a stimulant, enchantment or
curses, a gift from a divine source, artifacts used in creating the
world….
Whatever their origin or form, augments can serve any function, even
granting penalties or a mix or bonuses and penalties to the user
(Imagine a pair of boots that allows the user to teleport 3 squares as a
move action, but shrinks the wearer by 3” every time they are
activated).
A GM could rule that Augments are permanent and cannot be removed or
exchanged once they are applied to a piece of equipment. Perhaps in this
world, augments are rare artifacts, uncommon amongst new adventurers,
and badges of pride amongst veterans. If ever for sale, they would not
come cheap. 
Or maybe they’re commonplace, almost to the point of being valueless.
Simple augments (such as +1 accuracy) are</p>
<p>traded around, used as currency, or maybe crafted standard projects for
learning scholars.
 Below is a small table, giving some ideas of effects creative
augmentation might grant. GMs should be free to create and modify
augments at their discretion. Items such as the hand of glory (a
decrepit hand holding a candle that only the wielder can see the light
from) or bracers of calling (either wearer can teleport to the location
of the other bracer at will) can be crafted in a game, even without
having a specific augmentation applied to them. These augments are just
meant to give guidelines of powerful items that can be awarded to
players. Crossbows that shoot rope, warhammers that extend from 6” to
3’, none of these things are specifically allowed by these rules, but
GMs should not see this as a limitation to their existence.</p>

<p><strong>Improvised Weapons</strong>
 Sometimes a traditional weapon simply isn’t available. For these times,
a character can pick up a chair, table leg, bottle, a fallen comrade, or
anything else available to use as an improvised weapon. These weapons
cannot be augmented, and typically break after little use. 
 Any weapon, melee or thrown, that does not qualify as a standard weapon
is considered to be an improvised weapon. All improvised weapons start
by doing a d4 damage. This value is modified the same way regular
weapons are (wielded two-handed, large/small creature, etc.). See page
Error: Reference source not found for more information on calculating
damage.
 There are some warriors who excel at using what is around them as a
weapon. These few creatures are capable of dealing massive amounts of
damage with anything they can find. 
 Since these weapons are improvised, they take damage just like other
objects, and can break in the same manner. See page 93 for more

<p>Armor is defined as being either light armor or heavy armor. As with
weapons, the object used as armor (or as a shield) is left up to the
creativity of the player and the restriction of the GM. For example, a
character in light armor might be wearing kittens (or the bodies of, so
as not to incur stealth penalties), while one in heavy armor might use a
small shed. For a shield, one may consider a car door. Traditional armor
(such as shining plate, chainmail, or animal hides) may also be used, if
they are more appropriate for the campaign. It does not matter what is
used, all items function the same way. Discuss with a GM whether your
idea for armor would be classified as &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;light&quot;. Keep in mind
not just the weight of the armor, but also the relative bulkiness of the
armor, how dexterous it would allow your character to be, and the weight
of the armor relative to the character. What is light armor for André
the Giant would probably not be light armor for your seven-year-old
niece.

<h2 id="defenses-western-style-page-break-before-always-">Defenses </h2>
<p><strong>AC</strong>
AC, or Armor Class, is a creature’s ability to avoid taking damage from
(typically melee) attacks. This can be by dodging a blow, or, usually,
by letting armor absorb the force of a blow. 

<strong>Fortitude</strong>
Fortitude is character’s ability to resist being pulled, pushed, knocked
prone, or poisoned. Characters with high fortitude can fend of diseases,
and can usually hold their ground against even the mightiest of blows.

<strong>Reflex</strong>
Reflex is a measure of a character’s ability to dodge projectiles, such
as rocks, as well as many magical assaults, such as fireballs or
lightning. Note that particularly skilled archers can target a
creature’s reflex, making the target dodge an arrow, rather than
targeting AC, and forcing a character to ignore a hit.

<strong>Will</strong>
Will is a character’s mental prowess as it relates to resisting the
effects of domination, dazing, and other mind-altering conditions.
Characters with high Will can fend of mental intruders, and are capable
of identifying intruding thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="spells-by-school-western-">Spells By School </h2>
<p>Characters can learn a number of spells equal to their modifier in the
appropriate school skill. Below is a list of spells sorted by school.
For more information on a spell’s prerequisites and effects, see page
55.</p>

<p>5<strong>Spells By School</strong></p>
<p><strong>Targeting Multiple Creatures:<em>**</em></strong></p>
<p>Being proficient with unarmed combat or using certain spells allows
characters to target multiple creatures. Whenever more than one creature
is targeted with one attack (as of a spell), separate attack rolls are
made, but the same damage is used for every attack. This may be in the
form of a burst, blast, or simply targeting multiple creatures.
-In the case of unarmed combat, different attacks are made, so both the
attack roll and the damage are rolled separately.</p>

<h2 id="fortune-points-western-style-page-break-before-always-">Fortune Points </h2>
<p>Each character has a number of Fortune points equal to their Luck
modifier.</p>
<p>Any roll of a 20 on a d20 results in the gaining of one additional
fortune point. Any roll of a 1 on a d20 results in the loss of one
fortune point. A player will never have less than zero fortune points.
If a player uses fortune points for a d20 roll, and the result is a 20,
the fortune points are not expended, and one is gained. Spending Fortune
points is a free action, and may be done at any time. Fortune points
reset at the end of each day. Extra Fortune points gained by rolling 20s
are lost if not used.</p>

<p>Fortune points can be used for:</p>
<p>• Adding to any roll. Before the roll is made, spend a number of Fortune
points to add that same number to the roll.</p>
<p>• Increasing a defense (AC, Reflex, Fortitude, Will) for a turn. Spend
any number of Fortune points before an attack roll is made to increase a
defense of your choice by that same number. This can be done even while
unconscious or helpless.</p>
<p>• Gain an extra standard action. Spend 5 Fortune points on your turn for
an extra standard action.</p>
<p>A number of Talents can further increase the usefulness of Fortune
points.</p>
<h2 id="truths-western-">Truths </h2>
<p>The number of active Truths you can have at once, as well as the amount
of Enlightenment points a character has is determined by the
Enlightenment skill (page Error: Reference source not found).</p>
<hr>
<p>  <strong>5</strong>     + 2 to attack rolls
  <strong>10</strong>    Increase damage die by 1
  <strong>15</strong>    +2 Movement
  <strong>20</strong>    Make a saving throw
  <strong>20</strong>    Detect Evil: You can detect malice and intent to harm on a creature within your Enlightenment range.
  <strong>25</strong>    +2 AC, Fortitude, Reflex, or Will
  <strong>30</strong>    Heal 10 hit points
  <strong>35</strong>    +2 to all defenses
  <strong>40</strong>    Increase damage multiplier by 1
  <strong>40</strong>    Exorcise: All intangible creatures within your Enlightenment modifier are teleported to a random plane or location (not within 5 miles)
  <strong>45</strong>    + 4 damage
  <strong>50</strong>    + 4 Movement
  <strong>55</strong>    Automatically save against one effect a save can end
  <strong>60</strong>    The next d20 you roll can be rolled twice. Choose either result.
  <strong>60</strong>    Smite: You deal 1d8 times your Enlightenment modifier extra damage to your next attack.
  <strong>65</strong>    +5 AC, Fortitude, Reflect, or Will
  <strong>70</strong>    +5 all defenses
  <strong>75</strong>    Immune to Melee or Ranged attacks
  <strong>80</strong>    Gain an extra standard action
  <strong>80</strong>    Cure Disease: You immediately remove all diseases, plagues, and ailments from one creature you are touching.
  <strong>85</strong>    Immune to harmful spells
  <strong>90</strong>    If you hit with an attack, treat it as a critical hit
  <strong>95</strong>    Increase damage multiplier by 5
  <strong>100</strong>   + 10 to attack
  <strong>100</strong>   Survival: For the next 10 days, you do not need to eat or breathe, and can withstand temperatures from -300 to 300°F.</p>
<hr>



<p>Activating a Truth deducts the level of the Truth from total
Enlightenment points. For example, activating +2 damage would cost ten
points to cast, and, in order to sustain the effect, ten points at the
end of each subsequent turn would also be deducted.</p>
<p>Enlightenment points restore to full at the end of each encounter.</p>
<p>As a standard action on your turn, you may reset your Enlightenment
points to full.</p>
