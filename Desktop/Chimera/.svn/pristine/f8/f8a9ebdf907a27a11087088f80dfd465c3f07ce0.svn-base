We can either make them alphabetic by parent, or sort by cost then alphabetic by parent, which is how the 
demos are. Let me know which you prefer.

Alternatively, we could (since I did it by scale) have big lines indicating what "threshold they are crossing.
So it's clearly marked (or possibly lightly shaded) from zone to zone, where each zone is a requisite score in x school.
