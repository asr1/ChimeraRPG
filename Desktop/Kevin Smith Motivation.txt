KEV SAYS: I love your post. Thanks for the kind words.
Honestly? Death motivates me. One day it all ends for our hero, and he doesn't get to express myself anymore. Nightmare thought for a motor mouth full of ideas (some of which are actually good). What am I waiting for? Might as well spit it all out now while I've got the chance.
You know what also helps? Change up the creative outlet from time to time. A writer writes, sure - but a writer can also podcast, and sometimes saying shit out loud can help. Or go take some photographs. Or shoot a short film. Or paint. Even if the words aren't flowing, capture SOME moment that you can share or convey to others: that's your only job as an artist. Don't worry about whether it's "good" or "bad", as art is in the eye of the beholder anyway. You just capture the moment, by any means necessary (Except, y'know, any way that hurts or kills someone else).
